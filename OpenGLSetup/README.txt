# CPS511 Assignment 2

## How to run
- Go to visual studio, open and select OpenGLSetup from my assignment 2 folder.


## Overview
This program implements an interactive shape modeling tool using surfaces of revolution. Users can:
- Design a profile curve in a 2D window using subdivision.
- Generate a 3D surface of revolution in a separate 3D window.
- Manipulate the view with camera controls and toggle drawing styles.

## Features
- Draw 2D subdivision curves interactively.
- Generate 3D surfaces of revolution.
- Toggle between solid, wireframe, and point rendering modes.
- Display normal vectors for the wireframe.
- Camera controls for rotation, elevation, and zoom.

## What works
- n for normal
- p for points
- l for lines
- right click and hold then drag to go up and down
- left click and hold then drag to go along the x axis.

## Attempted but doesn't work
- VAO setup - setupVAO();
- commented out drawing using vaos instead of direct mode
- import and export mesh functions - importMesh(), exportMesh()
